# Zac Moss

## Who am I?

I’m Zac Moss, I’m a full-stack software engineer and alumni of the Makers Academy July ‘22 cohort. I write in Javascript (including React and React Native) and Ruby.

I learned to code after meeting software engineers working remote while on a rock climbing trip in Thailand. I loved the sound of a career that allowed so much flexibility! When I returned I entered lockdown and immediately started a course on Codecademy. I’ve been hooked ever since.
